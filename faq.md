# FAQ

### Do I have to be registered for the main conference to participate at the workshop?
Yes. Registration can be found [here](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=6IW_BWzwEUe-0OVajAezTLde7uP09t1OvWn4hSgwq89UQ0g3TlE0S1VSWjNPTkxVRzU4VkNEMEk2MC4u). 



### Who can apply to attend the event ?
Although the event is open to anyone willing to attend, the target audience for this workshop are STEM student,  at the levels of `Masters`, but also interested PhD's and young researchers, and of course [AIMS students](https://aims.ac.za/). As prerequisites, we shal leverage on Computational skills: Background that includes some (beginners' level) Python/R; Rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python. It is not required but would be an advantage if one followed an undergraduate course in topology (e.g. chapter 1-3 of `J.R. Munkres: Topology`). Ideally, the student should be familiar with the construction of free vector spaces and quotient vector spaces, representation of linear maps by matrices, and matrix operations such as multiplication and row/column operations. We will mostly be concerned with finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of two elements (and occasionally other prime fields).
