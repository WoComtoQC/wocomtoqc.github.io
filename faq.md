# FAQ

### Do I have to be registered for the main conference to participate at the workshop?
Yes. Registration can be found [**here**](https://forms.office.com/pages/responsepage.aspx?id=6IW_BWzwEUe-0OVajAezTLde7uP09t1OvWn4hSgwq89UQ0g3TlE0S1VSWjNPTkxVRzU4VkNEMEk2MC4u). Once you have registered, join [**our slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/wocomtoqc/shared_invite/zt-1m9fmhp82-rrOnfEMqyc3tA0O0bBPGvg).

| **Deadline**    | *Initially* ~~10th January 2023~~, Extended **6th February 2023** (23:59 AoE)|



### Who can apply to attend the event ?
Although the event is open to anyone willing to attend, the target audience for this workshop are STEM student,  at the levels of `Masters`, but also interested PhD's and young researchers, and of course [**AIMS students**](https://aims.ac.za/). As prerequisites, we shal leverage on Computational skills: Background that includes some (beginners' level) Python/R; Rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python. It is not required but would be an advantage if one followed an undergraduate course in topology (e.g. chapter 1-3 of `J.R. Munkres: Topology`). Ideally, the student should be familiar with the construction of free vector spaces and quotient vector spaces, representation of linear maps by matrices, and matrix operations such as multiplication and row/column operations. We will mostly be concerned with finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of two elements (and occasionally other prime fields).


### I have not registered, can I still attend?
Yes, you can still attend even though registration is closed. [**Here is the link to our Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/wocomtoqc/shared_invite/zt-1m9fmhp82-rrOnfEMqyc3tA0O0bBPGvg). We'll post a link to join the sessions via Zoom even if you aren't able to register! Feel free to reach out to [**Colleen**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleenmfarrelly/) or [**Ya√©**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabayae/), should you experience any problem.


### A few other things:
1. Star the [**workshop repository on GitHub**](https://github.com/WoComtoQC/wocomtoqc.github.io) as well as the [**original website template repository**](https://github.com/tda-in-ml/tda-in-ml.github.io).
