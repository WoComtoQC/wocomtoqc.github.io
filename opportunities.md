# Work with us.

  1. We are always looking for motivated students with whom I could work on innovative solutions in the field of Data Science, both from a
theoretical than from a practical point of view.

  2. I could make myself available for Master's thesis supervision, especially if the student is interested in subjects with a strong mathematical component. In particular in the field
algorithmics when we want to see applications of certain topological structures within the framework of the complexity analysis of certain algorithms.

  3. We are also open to exchanges on potential projects that would lead to the establishment of start-ups.


In addition, we regularly post scholarship and work opportunities on this [**Telegram channel**](https://t.me/bourse_et_opportunites_d_etudes). You can subscribe to it.


You can also check this [data science and big data analytics](https://quantumleapafrica.org/re_unit/data-science-and-big-data-analytics/) page to see what we do at QLA.
