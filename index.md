Welcome to the introductory SageMath course. You will find on this site all the necessary information and resources.

# Insight


This course illustrates how experiments can help mathematicians to solve mathematical problems (prove or disprove mathematical claims). In addition to a pen and a piece of paper, some mathematical experiments require computer assistance. In such cases we will use the System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation ([SAGE](https://www.sagemath.org/)).




For this course, LIVE discussions! can be done on can be done on [**Slack**](https://join.slack.com/t/expemathsage/shared_invite/zt-1i7emlfzk-493ihFBaKQOzPlArPw~q7w). You can always join the discussion and ask your questions, even when the course is over.
