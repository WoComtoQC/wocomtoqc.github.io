 `Quantum Computing and Topological Data Analysis for beginners`


### Overview : 


|**Type** |    Training school & Workshop (aka `wosum (workshop and summer school)`)
| **Duration/Date** | Five-day workshop from the 6th February to 10th February 2023 |
| **Format** | Hybrid – Online & In-person
| **Location** | The workshop will be *hybrid*, both virtually and in person in QLA Training room in [Kigali](https://goo.gl/maps/V3sVz7VZiTpwLrPW9), Rwanda. |

 `Target audience` : Masters, interested PhD's and young researchers, AIMS students.
 
 #### Preference : 
   1. Computational skills: Background that includes some (beginners' level) Python/R; Rudimentary knowledge of programming in Python.    
   2. (undergraduate) Mathematics/Physics background; An undergraduate course in topology (e.g. chapter 1-3 of `J.R. Munkres: Topology` should be familiar). The student should be familiar with the construction of free vector spaces and quotient vector spaces, representation of linear maps by matrices, and matrix operations such as multiplication and row/column operations. We will mostly be concerned with finite-dimensional vector spaces over the field of two elements (and occasionally other prime fields).

# Background

Topological Data Analysis combines ideas from topology and also algebra, geometry, and analysis, with the objective of analyzing contemporary data sets for which standard approaches are unsatisfactory.  A motivating idea is that there is an underlying ''shape'' to the data and that new variants of some of the sophisticated tools of modern mathematics may be brought to bear to elucidate and learn from this structure. Topology is a mathematical discipline that studies shapes, sets of points and their invariants under continuous deformations such as the number of connected components, holes, tunnels or cavities. Metric properties such as the position of a point, the distance between points, or the curvature of a surface are not relevant to topology. Some datasets are too small for standard statistical/data analysis to accurately characterize the data. Others are extremely large and data size reduction methods may be needed. One solution is to use topological data analysis to simplify and/or visualize data. This workshop will include both tutorials and research talks on topological techniques for visualizing data. Quantum machine learning is a relatively new field of machine learning that leverages the power of quantum computing to optimize new and existing machine learning models, including quantum neural networks, quantum annealing, and quantum network science algorithms. These algorithms are specially-designed to run on quantum computers and often provide a speed-up of run-time for combinatorial optimization problems. In the past few years, quantum algorithms have found use on initial real-world problems. This workshop will introduce the field and dive into a bit of the application of quantum algorithms in the real-world and in research settings.
