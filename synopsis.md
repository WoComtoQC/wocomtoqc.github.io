# Synopsis

Mathematicians do not only need a pen and a piece of paper but also computer assistance to run some mathematical experiments.  This course illustrates how  System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation ([SAGE](https://www.sagemath.org/)) experiments can help mathematicians to solve mathematical problems (prove or disprove mathematical claims for e.g.).

There are three main goals for the course:

   1. Begin to think of mathematics as an experimental science.  
      . We will use elementary number theory, Linear Algebra, Abstract Algebra and Graph Theory as our lens in our explorations.

   2. Learn mathematical proof methods to prove some of the conjectures we will discover in 1. 

   3. Learn the basics of how to use the Sagemath software to do, compute, and explore mathematics.
