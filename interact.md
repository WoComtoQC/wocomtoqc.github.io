Submission Deadline:  Wednesday 2nd October by 9 PM.
Winners announced during the class on Friday 4th October .
Participation is optional but strongly encouraged!


The submitted work should contain original ideas of students.  __Group work is encouraged!__ The jury will consider following aspects of each work:
 - the originality of  the idea
 - the quality of graphics
 - the scientific message and content 
 - the explanation of  ideas and the possible application of the Sage "@interact"


The interact resources on the [Resources](https://expemathsage.github.io/ressources) page might be a good source of inspiration as well as knowledge, as are
[Wolfram Demonstrations](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fdemonstrations.wolfram.com&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHy9B_2lhoy-xLn9fzsDsaMYV_3WA) or any scientific illustrations on the web.  While @interacts found on the web may be used as inspiration, the submissions should be 
__primarily students' work__.



## Submission Protocol:

 - Create an interact in ONE cell in a worksheet.
 - Explain it as described above in ONE text cell in the worksheet.
 - Put your name or all members of a group clearly in the explanation.
 - Call it `Your__Group_Name_Interact_Submission` (for example, `Group_1_Interact_Submission`) and download it as a Jupyter notebook.
 - Reply to the official announcement email from me or the tutor, with the sage interact jupyter notebook attached. Note that all worksheet should contain the names of the group members.
 - Relax!
