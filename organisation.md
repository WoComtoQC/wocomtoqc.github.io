# Course organization

The lessons will be given in the form of lessons / practical work, a few minutes of theory in *live coding* will be followed by immediate practice.

As an indication, we detail in the following the breakdown of the different sessions. This division is likely to change depending on the degree of advancement of the whole class. Do not hesitate to come back to this page regularly during the lecture.
 

## Virtual course notebooks
 
You will find the virtual notebooks for this course on [**this GitHub repository**]() that you can [**Fork**](/fork).


## The course will be organised as follows: 

  - Daily lectures: A brief summary of what went on in class and exercises related to what we did and what we will be possibly doing next time.

  - Homework: Contains a list of all handed-in homework problems and their due dates.

  - Resources: All kinds of Sage-related resources will be placed here.

  - Interact competition: See the interact competition page for more details.
   
  - Remember, this is Experimental Mathematics with Sage, so our focus will be:
    - First, on trying to be more experimental and inquiring about our mathematics.
    - Second, on learning to use Sage as a tool for computation and experimentation.
