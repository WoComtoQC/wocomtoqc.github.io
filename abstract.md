 |Tamara Kohler  |  Quantum complexity classes and topological data analysis | Recently progress has been made on the long-standing question of the computational complexity of determining homology groups of simplicial complexes, a fundamental task in computational topology, posed by Kaibel and Pfetsch 20 years ago. It was shown that the complexity of versions of the problem is closely linked to quantum complexity classes, suggesting that this seemingly classical problem may in fact be quantum. In this talk I explain why this problem in topology should have anything to do with quantum mechanics, and give an overview of recent results on the complexity of homology. I will discuss what these results suggest for the possibility of quantum advantage in topological data analysis, and open questions. |
  | Colleen M. Farrelly | Hands-On Workshop Series: Forman-Ricci Curvature Applications, BERT, Metric Geometry, and Persistent Homology  | Depending time, we'll 1) overview Forman-Ricci curvature and apply it to social network, spatial, and spatiotemporal data; 2) examine how word embeddings wrangle text data into supervised learning pipelines; 3) explore metric geometry and nearest neighbors algorithms to see how local properties of manifolds impact prediction accuracy; and 4) apply persistent homology to identify transition points in time series data. Most tutorials will be in Python (except #4, which will be in R). Notebooks and data will be provided so students can follow along. |
   | Vanessa Robins | Topological Data Analysis: Introduction and Application  |  Topological Data Analysis has grown out of work focussed on deriving qualitative and yet quantifiable information about the shape of data. The underlying assumption is that knowledge of shape - the way the data are distributed in a space - permits high-level reasoning and modelling of the processes that created this data. The 0-th order aspect of shape is the number pieces: “connected components” to a topologist; “clustering” to a statistician. Higher-order topological aspects of shape are holes, quantified as “non-bounding cycles” in homology theory. These signal the existence of some type of constraint on the data- generating process. Homology lends itself naturally to computer implementation, but its naive application is not robust to perturbations. This inspired the development of persistent homology: an algebraic topological tool that measures changes in the topology of a growing sequence of spaces (a filtration). Persistent homology provides invariants called the barcodes or persistence diagrams that are sets of intervals recording the birth and death parameter values of each homology class in the filtration. It captures information about the shape of data over a range of length scales and enables a distinction between noisy and significant structures that is continuous with respect to perturbation.  This rich geometric summary has found application in fields ranging from astrophysics to materials science and biostatistics.|
