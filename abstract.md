| [**Agnese Barbensi**](https://sites.google.com/view/agnesebarbensi/home) (University of Melbourne, Australia)     | The hypergraph of persistence homology cycles  |  Persistent Homology (PH), the main tool in Topological Data Analysis (TDA), analyses the shape of data via their topological features. In the standard PH pipeline, the first step is to build a sequence of simplicial complexes approximating the data at different scales.  The evolution of homology groups of these complexes, summarised in a persistent diagram (PD), provides a powerful structural descriptor of the data.  Computing homology generators, i.e. subsets of data giving rise to the topological features, allows for a local interpretation of the abstract PD summary. In this talk we will explore techniques to include homology generators in the PH pipeline, and we will see how these can be used to infer geometric and structural information in the case of spatial curves. |
|  [**Elizabeth Munch**](http://www.elizabethmunch.com/) (Michigan State University, USA) | The Directional Transform -or- How to look at your data from every direction at once|  The field of topological data analysis (TDA) has emerged as a robust method for measuring the shape of data.  This field of research takes ideas from algebraic topology, in concert with ideas from algorithms, statistics, category theory, and others, to provide methods for quantifying the shape of data. This data can either be cases where shape is obvious, such as studying the shape of a plant seed, or not-so-obvious, such as studying the shape of a reconstructed attractor from a time series. In this talk, we will discuss an idea that has been weaving its way through more and more of the developing TDA methodology; that is, the directional transform. The idea is that since most methods in TDA require input consisting of a topological space with a real valued function, however it is not always obvious what that function should be. In particular, when we are in the setting where we have access to a region of Euclidean space, we can probe the shape with a function and compute a representation such as a persistence diagram, but which direction to choose? The directional transform, first introduced by Turner et al, takes as representation the topological signature for all directions at once. The result is a summary which can be used from theoretical analysis to computational experiments such as being an input to machine learning models. In this talk, we will discuss some uses of the directional transform, including for understanding structures such as X-Ray CT scans of barley seeds as well as for comparing embedded graphs.   | 
|   [**David Gleich**](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/dgleich/) (Purdue University, USA)   | TOPOLOGICAL METHODS TO ANALYZE COMPLEX PREDICTION MECHANISMS | It is now standard practice across science to study models that have been trained, fit, or learned based on a set of data. Many of these models involve a large number of parameters that make direct interpretation of the model challenging and a near black-box model view appropriate. We explore the possibilities of using ideas based on topological analysis methods to understand and evaluate these complex prediction functions. These show a surprising ability to generate easy to understand insights into these black boxes.         |    
|   [**Jose Perea**](https://www.joperea.com/) (Northeastern University, USA)   | A topological study of the space of planar pentagons | Conformation spaces of molecules are known to have non-trivial topology, which can complicate tasks like dimensionality reduction for dynamics modeling with intrinsic variables. In this talk, I'll describe the space of planar pentagons -- a toy model for conformation spaces  -- and general methods to leverage topological data analysis for dimensionality reduction and visualization.   |    
|  [**Bastian Rieck**](https://bastian.rieck.me/) (AIDOS Lab, Germany)   |  Topology-Based Graph Learning | Topological data analysis is starting to establish itself as a powerful and effective framework in machine learning , supporting the analysis of neural networks, but also driving the development of novel algorithms that incorporate topological characteristics. As a problem class, graph representation learning is of particular interest here, since graphs are inherently amenable to a topological description in terms of their connected components and cycles. This talk will provide an overview of how to address graph learning tasks using machine learning techniques, with a specific focus on how to make such techniques 'topology-aware.' We will discuss how to learn filtrations for graphs and how to incorporate topological information into modern graph neural networks, resulting in provably more expressive algorithms. This talk aims to be accessible to an audience of TDA enthusiasts; prior knowledge of machine learning is helpful but not required.          |    
 |[**Tamara Kohler**](https://www.ucm.es/mathqi/tamara-kohler) (Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas Madrid) |  Quantum complexity classes and topological data analysis | Recently progress has been made on the long-standing question of the computational complexity of determining homology groups of simplicial complexes, a fundamental task in computational topology, posed by Kaibel and Pfetsch 20 years ago. It was shown that the complexity of versions of the problem is closely linked to quantum complexity classes, suggesting that this seemingly classical problem may in fact be quantum. In this talk I explain why this problem in topology should have anything to do with quantum mechanics, and give an overview of recent results on the complexity of homology. I will discuss what these results suggest for the possibility of quantum advantage in topological data analysis, and open questions. |
  | [**Colleen M. Farrelly**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/colleenmfarrelly/) | Hands-On Workshop Series: Forman-Ricci Curvature Applications, BERT, Metric Geometry, and Persistent Homology  | Depending time, we'll 1) overview Forman-Ricci curvature and apply it to social network, spatial, and spatiotemporal data; 2) examine how word embeddings wrangle text data into supervised learning pipelines; 3) explore metric geometry and nearest neighbors algorithms to see how local properties of manifolds impact prediction accuracy; and 4) apply persistent homology to identify transition points in time series data. Most tutorials will be in Python (except #4, which will be in R). Notebooks and data will be provided so students can follow along. |
   | [**Vanessa Robins**](https://physics.anu.edu.au/contact/people/profile.php?ID=75) (The Australian National University) | Topological Data Analysis: Introduction and Application  |  Topological Data Analysis has grown out of work focussed on deriving qualitative and yet quantifiable information about the shape of data. The underlying assumption is that knowledge of shape - the way the data are distributed in a space - permits high-level reasoning and modelling of the processes that created this data. The 0-th order aspect of shape is the number pieces: “connected components” to a topologist; “clustering” to a statistician. Higher-order topological aspects of shape are holes, quantified as “non-bounding cycles” in homology theory. These signal the existence of some type of constraint on the data- generating process. Homology lends itself naturally to computer implementation, but its naive application is not robust to perturbations. This inspired the development of persistent homology: an algebraic topological tool that measures changes in the topology of a growing sequence of spaces (a filtration). Persistent homology provides invariants called the barcodes or persistence diagrams that are sets of intervals recording the birth and death parameter values of each homology class in the filtration. It captures information about the shape of data over a range of length scales and enables a distinction between noisy and significant structures that is continuous with respect to perturbation.  This rich geometric summary has found application in fields ranging from astrophysics to materials science and biostatistics.|
 | Sean Andrew Thawe | How To Get Started in Quantum Computing   |  Quantum computers aren’t the next generation of supercomputers but rather they are something else entirely. At the same time quantum computers aren’t developing in isolation of classical computing. Basically, when we look at classical computing at the unit level it stores information in bits. Which is binary, meaning two bits – or two states. Something with two states carries less amount of information. A bit is the smallest unit of classical computation and classical information. Quantum computation and quantum information are built on an analogous concept, the quantum bit, or qubit for short. Just like bits in classical computing, qubits are the core components in quantum computing.  As technology advances into A.I. and ML we find that training models requires quite huge amounts of data. Speeding up the process requires parallelizing the data processing as much as possible. Now with GPU – computer graphics card – its proving to help quite a lot. At the same time, it takes an exponential amount of data to solve the problem and that’s not a good thing, in turn that will mean an exponential number of operations to manipulate them is need. Data parallelization improves performance linearly so it is not a cure for problems with exponential complexity. Quantum computers may have its constraints but like any other technologies it has got Its own advantages. Quantum computers offer us entanglement and interference. Another advantage is superposition. Superposition is the reason that quantum computers can store and manipulate vast amounts of data compare to classical computers.  With superposition, we can encode an exponential amount of information that can scale a solution better than classical computing. There are several ways one can get started in quantum computing and also end up in Quantum Machine Learning. Quantum computing may have a lot to offer but it is still at its infancy stage. Another field developing in quantum computing is Quantum Machine Learning, which is still a theoretical field at the moment. It lies at the intersection quantum computing and machine learning.|
| Carlo Maria Scandolo |  The power of quantum resources | Resource theories are a powerful framework for studying several phenomena in quantum information. In this talk, I present some of my latest research results in this area, showing how resource theories can be fruitfully employed to open new research directions, both in quantum information and beyond.|
| Woojin Kim | Persistence diagrams via limit-to-colimit maps and Möbius inversions  | The persistence diagram (equivalently barcode) has been one of the most prevalent objects in topological data analysis (TDA) as an object which summarizes features of a persistence module. With the goal of adapting the idea behind persistent homology to the study of wider types of data (e.g. time-varying point clouds), variants of the indexing set of persistence modules inevitably occur, leading for example to multiparameter persistence and zigzag persistence. However, it is not always evident how to define a notion of persistence diagram for such variants. This talk will introduce a generalized notion of persistence diagram for many of such variants which arises through exploiting the principle of inclusion-exclusion from combinatorics and the notion of (co)limit from category theory. We describe how this resulting generalized persistence diagram subsumes some other well-known invariants of 2-parameter persistence modules and how it mediates between 2-parameter persistence and zigzag persistence. This talk is based on joint work with Nate Clause, Tamal Dey, Facundo Mémoli, and Samantha Moore.|
| Shael Brown | Applied topological data analysis in R with TDApplied  | Research methods, in academia or industry, typically use a standard set of tools to analyze structured data in order to discover patterns. These tools include statistical inference (like ANOVA), dimension reduction (like PCA), regression (like support vector machines), etc. When analyzing whole datasets, persistence diagrams capture topological shape features which cannot be uncovered by other methods. However, persistence diagrams are themselves unstructured, so how can we analyze groups of them in typical research workflows? Enter TDApplied – the first R (or python) package for analyzing groups of persistence diagrams with machine learning and statistical inference. In this workshop you will learn how to exploit the power of topological data analysis in your research via TDApplied methods, code a practical example analyzing neurological data from the Human Connectome Project, and reflect on how you could carry out your own applied topological research.|
 | Casper Gyurik | Quantum algorithms and the Betti number problem  | Over the past few years a lot of interesting research has been done on quantum algorithms for the Betti number problem. In this talk I will provide a general introduction to the Betti number problem, and I will give a survey on the relevant quantum-algorithmic results. In particular, I will discuss the most recent classical/quantum algorithms for the Betti number problem (inc. their advantages and shortcomings) and I will discuss the complexity theoretic landscape surrounding this problem. |
 | Gunnar Carlsson | Topological Data Modeling and Deep Learning  | Deep learning is a very powerful methodology use  in an number of situations.  One is the study of data sets of images, where it can produce very accurate using a particular class of computation graphs called convolutional neural networks.  On the other hand, topological data analysis has produced a good understanding for the statistics of natural images.  In this talk, we will show how to bridge this gap, and also produce ways to understand the inner workings of convolutional neural networks.  We will also show how to use topology to inform the constructions of specialized architectures that increase the generalization power as well as lessen the number of data points needed to train. |
 | Ulrich Bauer | Morse theory and persistent homology of geometric complexes | I will give an introduction and discuss some more recent results on the interplay between geometry and topology, and between Morse theory and persistent homology, in the setting of geometric complexes. This concerns constructions like Rips, Čech, Delaunay, and Wrap complexes, which are fundamental construction in topological data analysis. The tandem of Morse theory and homology shows the topological equivalence of several of these constructions, helps in speeding up their computation by a huge factor (in the software Ripser), reveals thresholds at which homology necessarily vanishes (with links to a classical result by Rips and Gromov), and relates a novel homology-based manifold reconstruction method to the industry-tested Wrap algorithm.|
 | Wolfgang Scherer | A Brief Summary of Quantum Computing | We give a summary of quantum computing (QC). Starting with basic notions such as entanglement, superposition, and quantum parallelism, we consider the various methods to harness quantum mechanics for computational purposes, such as gate-based QC, adiabatic QC, and simulation QC, as well as quantum cryptography. After a short walk through the quantum algorithm zoo, we present an example of how a quantum algorithm could make the Bitcoin signature insecure before we exhibit the basic ideas behind quantum error correction. |
 | David Adjei | TOPOLOGICAL DATA ANALYSIS AND COMPUTER SCIENCE  | Computational topology combines theoretical topological methods with efficient algorithms to analyse data and  solve problems in some fields of computer science. In this article we look at the various application of computational or  applied topology in computer science with reference to the following fields: Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, Machine  learning, and Computer Graphics or Image Processing. We realized that there has been a fast boost in the application of Topological Data Analysis in the above stated areas. This paper seeks to collect and summarize the most recent works connecting the application of Topological Data Analysis to computer science and the various methods used to incorporate  the tools of Topological Data Analysis into various applications in computer science. |

 | Ike Uchenna Chukwu | Fundamentals of Qubits and Quantum Circuits  | Quantum computing relies on the manipulation of quantum bits, also called qubits, which are fundamentally different from classical bits in their behavior and properties. Qubits have the ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously, known as superposition, and they become correlated through a phenomenon known as entanglement. Quantum circuits are the basic building blocks of quantum computing and are used to manipulate qubits to perform specific operations. Understanding the fundamentals of qubits and quantum circuits is crucial for developing practical applications of quantum computing. In this talk, we will delve into the basics of qubits and quantum circuits, and discuss their properties, limits, and potentials. |
 |Ahmed Younes| Potential Applications of Quantum Computing| Quantum computers are computational devices, which exploit quantum mechanical principles to do computation. Quantum computers promise to do computation more powerfully than conventional computers. Quantum computers arise as potential alternative for classical computers since the development in classical computers reaches its limit according to Moore’s Law, where the size of the components will hit the quantum level. In this talk, the mathematical foundations and potential applications of quantum computers will be presented. Different areas such as quantum circuit optimization, quantum algorithms, and quantum cryptography and communication will be explored.  |
